Laravel Doctrine ORM
====================

An integration library for Laravel and Doctrine ORM.
Version 3 of this library supports Laravel 10+,
Doctrine ORM ^3.0, and Doctrine DBAL ^4.0.


Introduction
============

Doctrine 2 is an object-relational mapper (ORM) for PHP that provides
transparent persistence for PHP objects.  It uses the Data Mapper pattern at
the heart, aiming for a complete separation of your domain/business logic
from the persistence in a relational database management system.

The benefit of Doctrine for the programmer is the ability to focus on the
object-oriented business logic and worry about persistence only as a
secondary problem. This doesnâ€™t mean persistence is downplayed by Doctrine 2.
However, it is our belief that there are considerable benefits for
object-oriented programming if persistence and entities are seperate.
